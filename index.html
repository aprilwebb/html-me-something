        <p>"Why is it wrong?!" I shouted to my friend, Chelsey. It was around 9:30pm on November 15, 2018. We
            were
            working on some
            homework for our online HTML/CSS class, and I could not understand why my test answers were coming
            back
            'incorrect.'
            But what Chelsey couldn't understand is why I was so upset about it. She suggested that I was either
            nearing my
            "time of the month" or that I was pregnant. I shrugged it off because I had <i>just</i>
            taken a pregnancy test 2 days prior. But to prove to Chelsey that I was not with child, I decided to
            take
            another test and show her
            the results.

        </p>

        <p>So, off I went to get the test answers that I was actually sure about. I called Chelsey in to come
            see
            the single line appear with me.
            And that's when it happened. Two lines, not one. "Is it supposed to look like that?" Chelsey asked.
            "Wait..." I said, in disbelief.
            I quickly pulled out another test. Positive. So then it was time to pull out the most reliable test:
            Clear Blue. And, yet again, the results were positive. "Babe! I think I'm pregnant!"
            I shouted through the house to my husband, Derek. He responded, "Okay," with a smile. I remember
            instantly
            feeling very fragile - afraid to do
            anything that could cause this little life inside me to suddenly stop growing. There began my
            everyday
            battle to trust God with the life of the
            child within me. I knew that God gave this little one to us. I believed that He was forming her
            inward
            parts and knitting her together in my womb
            (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm+139%3A13-14&version=ESV">Psalm
                139:13</a>) But it was easier for me to believe that
            something awful was going to happen (I tend to think of all the worst case scenarios). </p>

        <p> <img class="right-img" src="images/Mom.jpg" alt="Mom finds out baby is a girl" height="250" width="350">
            <br><br>Thankfully, nothing awful happened. I actually had a very smooth pregnancy. We found
            out in March that we were expecting a little girl.
            My mom was more excited than anyone, as evidenced by the photo to your right. This came as a huge
            surprise to us all,
            because I come from a family of mostly boys. I am one of five children and the other four are boys.
            So,
            I was certain that I was also carrying
            yet another grandson. But boy or girl really didn't matter to us. We were
            just excited to meet this little
            person. <br><br>
        </p>


        <p><img class="left-img" src="images/Waiting.JPG" alt="Waiting in the hospital" height="350"
                width="250"><br><br>
            Fast forward to 41 weeks! That's right - I went past my due date, despite asking this little babe to
            come
            a little early. After all, pregnancy
            is not the most comfortable experience. But for her, she was comfortable exactly where she was.
            So
            comfortable that she would not
            make her debut without a little help from the doctors and nurses at Advent Health. 41 weeks and one
            day is when I walked through
            the hospital doors on that Thursday evening to be induced, certain that we'd be meeting our little
            girl
            within just a few hours. <br> <br>

        </p>

        <p> I was nervous about being induced because I knew it increased the chances of needing a c-section -
            which
            I had
            decided
            I was <i>not</i> having.
            I'd heard recent statistics about women of color dying after giving birth because they weren't taken
            seriously, and
            I didn't want to increase the likelihood of something like that
            happening to me. About 12 hours after the induction, I still had not made much progress. So,
            they tried a different method to get things going. I was experiencing contractions all day long on
            Friday,
            but I was able to breathe through the pain and spent my day walking around the hospital floor.
            I walked the hospital hallways for what seemed like 100 times. Eventually, I had progressed enough
            for
            the nurses to start me on pitocin (also known as
            the worst drug on the face of the planet). That kicked things up a notch and my water broke after
            about
            an hour. "She's definitely coming
            tonight," I thought. </p>

        <p> Several painful hours later, I was told that the baby was positioned the wrong way. They would try
            to
            get
            her to turn,
            but the way she was positioned was going to make it more difficult for her to be delivered
            naturally.
            They told
            me that if she
            didn't turn, we'd have to consider "other options." But I knew exactly what that meant: a c-section.
            Around
            7am on Saturday morning,
            the midwives let me know they were recommending a c-section for the baby's safety and mine. The one
            thing
            I didn't want to happen
            was happening. I was devastated. But one thing helped me. As I prepared to go into surgery, I
            remembered
            a verse from a <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm+54%3A4&version=ESV">Psalm</a>
            I'd read the morning I
            went to the hospital:<br><br>
            <article id="verses">
                "Behold, God is my helper; the Lord is the upholder of my life." <br>
            </article>
        </p>

        <p> As I remembered that psalm, I was immediately encouraged to trust God with my life once again as I
            went
            in for the surgery
            I feared could end my life. This was not the first time that God was calling me to trust Him with my
            life.
            The first time was the summer of 2008. I had been
            learning about
            Him through a campus ministry at USF called the Navigators. I had grown up hearing that Jesus Christ
            died
            for sinners, but I never
            understood how that affected me or why He had to do that for me. I had never asked Him to die for
            me,
            after all.
            But that year I understood for the
            first
            time that
            my sin separated me from God
            because He is holy - meaning He is set apart and perfectly sinless. I learned that Jesus is the Son
            of
            God - <a href="https://www.desiringgod.org/articles/how-can-jesus-be-god-and-man">100% God and 100%
                man
            </a>-
            and that He lived a perfect, sinless life. He offered His perfect life as a sacrifice for all those
            who
            would put their trust in Him. It was a substitution, a great exchange: His perfect life for my
            sinful
            life.
            I finally understood why I needed a Savior and what Christ had done for me. So, the only appropriate
            response was to turn from my sin
            and believe the Gospel (the good news). This good news changed the course of my life at the age of
            18. I
            am
            thankful
            for God's intervention then and also on the day of Maya's birth. My life is a series of moments that
            God
            is
            using to teach
            me over and over again to put my trust and my hope in Him. And I think the birth of my daughter may
            have
            been
            the most challenging moment yet. But thankfully, God helped me that day.

            At 9:43am on Saturday, July 27th, Maya Elise Webb entered the world. We made it through the surgery
            with
            no
            complications. God reminded me that I am not in
            control of my life - but He is.
            He holds my life in His hands, and that is the safest place I can be. I didn't realize how much my
            life
            would
            be changed by this tiny person - I still don't think I realize it entirely. She has brought us so
            much
            joy and
            has helped me to understand more about God and the way He views His children. The Bible says that
            God
            rejoices over
            His people with loud singing and that He delights in them (<a
                href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=zeph+3%3A17&version=ESV">Zephaniah 3:17,</a>
            <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+62:4&version=ESV">Isaiah 62:4</a>).
            It's
            unfathomable to me that
            the same way that I delight in Maya, the Lord delights in me - all because He sees me in light of
            Jesus'
            sacrifice for me.
        </p>

            Motherhood has many challenges, but I'm so thankful that I get to be Maya's mom. We were not sure if
            we
            would be able
            to have children because of a medical condition I have, so the fact that she's here makes me so
            grateful. I'm excited
            to watch her grow up and see who she becomes. But until then, I'll be enjoying all the little
            moments
            and trying to trust
            God with her life, too.
